# Kahoot auto answer

This is all the source code to my Kahoot auto answer tool. It is made using Node.js and revolves around the Kahoot API.

### Instructions

1. Download the source code
2. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system
3. Navigate to the directory in Powershell, Terminal or Command Prompt, then type `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies
4. Once that command has finished type `npm run start` and the server will start. It will give you a url. That is the location of the server.
